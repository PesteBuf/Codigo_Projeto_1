Scanner 3D (Tomás da Costa Pereira 2023230488, David Gonçalo Carrão Ribeiro 2023230434):

The project consists of developing a 3D scanning system using Arduino, with the aim of measuring distances in 
different directions and building a map of points of the scanned object. 
The system will perform measurements with a laser distance sensor which, 
coupled to motors that move the laser and/or the object to be scanned, will 
capture the data necessary to reconstruct the object in 3D. The distance data
will be stored on an SD card and, through mathematical functions, the coordinates
of the points will be obtained, which can be viewed in a computer program.
